# Python Mini Projects 

This repository contains a collection of small Python practice projects I’m building while rebuilding my fundamentals and improving my backend development skills.

Each project focuses on a specific Python concept such as functions, loops, file handling, APIs, OOP, and error handling. These mini projects help strengthen my problem-solving abilities while preparing for larger applications (like my AI-Powered Resume Analyzer).

## Project List

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **simple-calculator** | Basic calculator program using user input and arithmetic operations. |
| **guessing-game** | Number guessing game using loops and conditionals. |
| **grocery-list** | CLI tool for adding/removing items using Python lists. |
| **contact-book** | Contact manager using dictionaries for key-value storage. |
| **password-generator** | Random password generator using functions and Python libraries. |
| **notes-app** | Simple text-based notes app with file read/write. |

<!--
| **bank-account** | OOP project simulating deposits, withdrawals, and account state. |
| **login-system** | Login/auth system with error handling and input validation. |
| **weather-api** | App that fetches weather data using a public API. |
| **web-scraper** | Web scraping script using BeautifulSoup to extract data. |
-->

More projects will be added as I continue learning and practicing.

## Purpose of This Repository

- Strengthen core Python fundamentals  
- Practice clean code, modular design, and documentation  
- Build momentum before larger backend/AI projects  
- Maintain consistent GitHub activity  
- Prepare for technical interviews and problem-solving challenges  

---

## Tech Used
- Python 3.x  
- BeautifulSoup (for scraping)  
- Requests (for API access)  
- File handling (JSON, text files)  
- OOP (classes & methods)  

---

## What’s Next?
I’m actively working on:

- **AI-Powered Resume Analyzer** (FastAPI + OpenAI API)  
- More backend and automation-related Python builds  
- LeetCode practice to improve problem-solving skills  

Stay tuned for more projects!
